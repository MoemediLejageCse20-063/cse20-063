                        <p>In general, courtesy is highly valued in Qatar. Hence, men are addressed as 'Sayyed', meaning 'Sir', followed by their full name. As regards women, they are addressed as 'Sayeeda' which means 'Madam'. Note that Arabic names can often be lengthy and confusing, male names in particular. But you are advised to use the full name, especially during meetings or official communications. Emirs are called "Your Highness" followed by 'Sheikh' and their full name.</p>

                        <h1>Dress code</h1>
                        <p>In public, Arabic women should dress up according to religious customs, covering themselves from head to toe. This traditional black dress is intended to protect them from others' sight. Once at home, there is no special restriction regarding their dressing code. In the case of professional meetings, they usually wear dark coloured pants or long skirts and blouses or jackets covering their elbows.As for men, they generally wear a long white cotton dress and a sort of cloth to cover their head called 'guthra'. But they may also wear western-style clothes, especially on informal occasions or at the beach.Foreigners, for their part, can wear more 'western' clothes. However, it is important to still dress in a conservative manner. Avoid wearing shorts and sleeveless T-shirts in public. The professional dress code for men consists of long pants, a shirt with long sleeves, and a tie.

                        <p> The holy month of Ramadan is a unique time in Qatar. It is generally considered very peaceful. Working hours are reduced for all organisations and very few restaurants (with the exception of some international hotels) will be open during the day. It is strictly forbidden to eat or drink in public spaces from sunrise to sunset. However, your employer may have a lounge or staff room where you are able to eat freely during the day.</p>

                        <p>Islamic festivities are generally determined according to the moon's visibility. In many Islamic countries, some festivities are based on information obtained from lunar observatories. But the Qatari population prefers more traditional methods. Therefore, dates can be subject to change at the last minute, especially since it has to be converted into Gregorian dates.</p>
