                                AHD-hah; Arabic: عيد الأضحى‎, romanized: ʿĪd al-ʾAḍḥā, lit. 'Feast of the Sacrifice', IPA: 
                                [ʕiːd al ˈʔadˤħaː]) is the latter of the two Islamic holidays celebrated worldwide each year (the other being Eid al-Fitr). 
                                It honours the willingness of Ibrahim (Abraham) to sacrifice his son Ismail (Ishmael) as an act of obedience to God's command. 
                                (The Jewish and Christian religions believe that according to Genesis 22:2, Abraham took his son Isaac to sacrifice.) 
                                Before Ibrahim could sacrifice his son, however, Allah provided a lamb to sacrifice instead. 
                                In commemoration of this intervention, animals are sacrificed ritually. 
                                One third of their meat is consumed by the family offering the sacrifice, while the rest is distributed to the poor and needy. 
                                Sweets and gifts are given, and extended family are typically visited and welcomed</p>
