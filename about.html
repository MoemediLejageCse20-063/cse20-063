                             <p>Qatar has come a long way from its roots as a British protectorate to become the wealthy state it is today. 
                                 It has made the most of the substantial proceeds of its oil and gas industries to gain a reputation on the world stage.
                                 Qatar is technically a constitutional monarchy, but in reality, the ruler (the Emir) possesses executive power to approve or reject the legislation. 
                                 The Emir appoints his own Prime Minister (which is usually a family member) and the members of legislative bodies. Ultimately, he has the final say on any laws that are drafted.</p>

                             <p>
                                At the turn of the 20th century, Doha was divided into 9 main districts.
                                 In the 2010 census, there were more than 60 districts recorded in Doha Municipality.
                                 Shortly after Qatar gained independence, many of the districts of old Doha including Al Najada, 
                                 Al Asmakh and Old Al Hitmi faced gradual decline and as a result, much of their historical architecture has been demolished.
                                 Instead, the government shifted their focus toward the Doha Bay area, 
                                 which housed districts such as Al Dafna and West Bay                              
                                  .</p>

                             <h3>HISTORY</h3>
                             <p>
                                Qatar’s economic prosperity is derived from the extraction and export of petroleum—discovered in 1939 and first produced in 1949—and natural gas. 
                                Before World War II, Qatar’s population engaged in pearling, fishing, 
                                and some trade (with little exception the only occupations available) and was one of the poorest in the world. 
                                By the 1970s, however, native Qataris enjoyed one of the highest per capita incomes in the world, 
                                despite subsequent declines in income due to fluctuations in world oil prices. 
                                Qatar’s original oil concession was granted to the Iraq Petroleum Company (IPC), 
                                a consortium of European and American firms.</p>
